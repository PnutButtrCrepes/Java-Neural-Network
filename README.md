# Java-Neural-Network
A neural network programmed entirely in Java.

This repository likely doesn't work accurately. I began working on this code a long time ago, then took a break to finish school and recently wanted to share it with the world.

I would like to fix up this code in the near future or have others who are willing to help me and share in this journey. I have noted things in the code that need worked on, but here are a few important things:

- Creating an actual average cost function and using that to determine how much the values of the weights and biases need to be changed.
- Implement different activation functions.
